<p>Define the Lagrangian as:</p>

<p>The optimization will be run on the assets which have a correlation coefficients over 0.1 with the innovations of the green sentiments. Otherwise, we could solve the opimization problem on the 1052 assets but the very high number of assets leads to a bad results in the optimization process.</p>
<p>For the optimization, I use the library <code>optimx</code> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optimx/index.html">see the description on this link</a>. In R, there are several packages for solving optimization problems. However, all of them are complements in the sense that they are each specialzed in one type of optimization (e.g.&nbsp;linear, quadratic, non-linear optimization). As I face non-linear optimization, <code>optimx</code> is the package the most adapted for this task. More specifically, I parameter the package to use the <em>Limited-memory BFGS</em> algorithm (which is in the family of quasi-Newton methods).</p>

<section id="application-of-the-methodology-of-de-nard-engle-kelly-2024" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Application of the methodology of De Nard, Engle, Kelly (2024)</h1>
<p>This method was developped by <span class="citation" data-cites="de2024factor">De Nard, Engle, and Kelly (<a href="#ref-de2024factor" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> on daily data. As I use this methodology on monthly data, I adapt their method to this frequency. Namely, the authors used a rolling regression (as the follwing one), instead I use a simple regression due to the low frequency of my data.</p>
<p>The <strong>first step</strong> is to run this regression on the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> assets in order to extract the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of each assets <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
r_{i,t} = \hat{\beta}_i IGS_t + \hat{\gamma}_i' \text{Factors}_t + \hat{\epsilon}_{i,t}
\]</span> The <strong>second step</strong> is to generate a signal based on the extracted <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, the authors propose three different methods to compute it. However, the most efficient one according to them is the following one:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\beta} = \max (\hat{\beta},0)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
b^{t-stat} = \frac{\tilde{\beta}^{t-stat}}{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{\beta}_i^{t-stat}} \ ; \ \tilde{\beta}_i^{t-stat} = \frac{\tilde{\beta}_i^2}{\hat{\sigma}_i^{HC3}} \ ; \ \tilde{\beta}^{t-stat} = (\tilde{\beta}_1^{t-stat}, \ldots , \tilde{\beta}_N^{t-stat})'
\]</span> Finally, the <strong>third step</strong> is to solve this opitmization problem for finding the optimal weights to eventually build the portfolio.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\min_w w'\hat{\Sigma}w - \lambda w'b^{t-stat} \\
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(1) \ \ \text{u.c.}\ w_i \geq 0 \ , \ \forall i \in [1,N] \ \ (2) \ \ \text{u.c.} \ \sum w_i = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a parameter to add more weights on the signal during the optimization. If <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \rightarrow \infty\)</span> the optimization problem will only take into account the signal and not the covariance matrix, which will lead to investing only in assets which have the biggest <span class="math inline">\(b_i^{t-stat}\)</span>. Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=0\)</span>, the optimization solution will be the constrained minimum-variance portfolio without any signal information.</p>
