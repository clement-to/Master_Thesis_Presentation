<p>On this page, I apply two methodologies for building the climate sentiment hedge portfolio through the mimicking portfolio approach. The first is the <em>maximum correlation portfolio</em>, a foundational approach developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="huberman1987mimicking">Huberman, Kandel, and Stambaugh (<a href="#ref-huberman1987mimicking" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>, which identifies portfolios that maximize correlation with the target factor. The second is a novel method introduced by <span class="citation" data-cites="de2024factor">De Nard, Engle, and Kelly (<a href="#ref-de2024factor" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For this preliminary analysis, I have used monthly data due to its stability and availability for capturing long-term trends in climate sentiment. Future work will refine this approach using weekly data to improve granularity and responsiveness to climate-related news.</p>
<p>Both methodologies rely on optimization processes to allocate optimal weights across assets. I employ the <code>optimx</code> library in <em>R</em> <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/optimx/versions/2024-12.2/topics/optimx">see optimx</a> to perform this task. Among the various optimization libraries available in <em>R</em>, <code>optimx</code> is particularly suited for non-linear optimization problems, which arise in this context due to the complexity of the asset covariance structure. Specifically, I parameterize the function to utilize the <em>Limited-memory BFGS</em> algorithm, a quasi-Newton method renowned for its efficiency in high-dimensional, constrained optimization problems.</p>

<p>The optimization will be run on assets with correlation coefficients greater than 0.1 with the innovations of the green sentiment index. This threshold ensures that only assets with meaningful relationships to the target factor are included in the optimization process.</p>
<p>Running the optimization on all 1,052 assets is theoretically possible but not practical, as the high number of assets leads to poor results due to increased noise and computational inefficiencies. By focusing on a smaller subset of relevant assets, the optimization process becomes more robust and yields better outcomes.</p>

<section id="application-of-the-methodology-of-de-nard-engle-kelly-2024" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Application of the methodology of De Nard, Engle, Kelly (2024)</h1>
<p>This method was developed by <span class="citation" data-cites="de2024factor">De Nard, Engle, and Kelly (<a href="#ref-de2024factor" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> using daily data. Since I am applying this methodology to monthly data, I have adapted their approach to this lower frequency.</p>
<p>Specifically, while the authors used a rolling regression (as shown below), I employ a simple regression due to the lower frequency of my data. This adjustment ensures the methodology remains effective and appropriate for the characteristics of monthly observations.</p>
<p>The <strong>first step</strong> is to run this regression on the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> assets in order to extract the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of each assets <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
r_{i,t} = \hat{\beta}_i IGS_t + \hat{\gamma}_i' \text{Factors}_t + \hat{\epsilon}_{i,t}
\]</span> The <strong>second step</strong> is to generate a signal based on the extracted <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, the authors propose three different methods to compute it. However, the most efficient one according to them is the following one:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\tilde{\beta} = \max (\hat{\beta},0)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
b^{t-stat} = \frac{\tilde{\beta}^{t-stat}}{\sum_{i=1}^N \tilde{\beta}_i^{t-stat}} \ ; \ \tilde{\beta}_i^{t-stat} = \frac{\tilde{\beta}_i^2}{\hat{\sigma}_i^{HC3}} \ ; \ \tilde{\beta}^{t-stat} = (\tilde{\beta}_1^{t-stat}, \ldots , \tilde{\beta}_N^{t-stat})'
\]</span> Finally, the <strong>third step</strong> is to solve this opitmization problem for finding the optimal weights to eventually build the portfolio.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\min_w w'\hat{\Sigma}w - \lambda w'b^{t-stat} \\
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(1) \ \ \text{u.c.}\ w_i \geq 0 \ , \ \forall i \in [1,N] \ \ (2) \ \ \text{u.c.} \ \sum w_i = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a parameter to add more weights on the signal during the optimization. If <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \rightarrow \infty\)</span> the optimization problem will only take into account the signal and not the covariance matrix, which will lead to investing only in assets which have the biggest <span class="math inline">\(b_i^{t-stat}\)</span>. Conversely, if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=0\)</span>, the optimization solution will be the constrained minimum-variance portfolio without any signal information.</p>
<section id="application" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Application</h2>
<p>For the application I choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 8\)</span> in a discrete manner in order to create a portfolio that is very sensible to the signal <span class="math inline">\(b^{t-stat}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The performance of the out-of-sample portfolio seems bad as the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is not significant and its value is almost equal to 0 for each <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. The next step of my master thesis is to solve this issue by using higher frequency data (e.g.&nbsp;using my green sentiment indicator at a weekly frequency) to ultimately using rolling regressions for the creation of the <span class="math inline">\(b^{t-stat}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The method of <span class="citation" data-cites="de2024factor">De Nard, Engle, and Kelly (<a href="#ref-de2024factor" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> does not seem to outperform the basic approach of the <em>maximum correlation portfolio</em> (<span class="citation" data-cites="huberman1987mimicking">Huberman, Kandel, and Stambaugh (<a href="#ref-huberman1987mimicking" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>), when monthly data are concerned. Thus, I will use weekly data to follow more closely the methodology developped by <span class="citation" data-cites="de2024factor">De Nard, Engle, and Kelly (<a href="#ref-de2024factor" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> in the next step of my master thesis.</p>
